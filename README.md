# Diabetic_retinopathy
In this classification model we try to predict the diseases according to the given image
Steps in this building the model
1. First of all we try to gather the relevant images for the classification.<br>
2. Second we preprocess the image data <br>
3. We build a model according to our problem <br>
   In this case we choose CNN for our model building
   <br>
   Then we train the model it means how many epochs will it run
   <br>
   What will be its batch size<br>
   Then we try to test its accuracy <br>
   how much accuracy it can get in this it is getting 70 %, if we try to test with an image<br>
   Then we try to predict the image and made a separate file for predict.py
